* This is a small piece of code that forms the core of your operating system. 
* You the user will not interact with the kernel, but devices you use, like a keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, or a Wi-Fi network card will do so when you take any action on the system. 
* How do the devices talk to the kernel? They speak to the kernel via device drivers
